# xHAKT
xHAKT is an SBS Boston hackathon project that aims to provide insight to the question, "_Do different types of phytoplankton have different abilities to absorb and sequester CO2?_"

# Why Quantifying Carbon Sequestration of Phytoplankton in Oceans is Important

# How xHAKT Contributes to Quantifying Carbon Sequestration of Phytoplankton
xHAKT enables researchers to easily document and source research data related to phytoplankton, ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent. 

By using of blockchain and decentralized storage solutions, we ensure that all data is secure and tamper proof. The use of co2.storage further ensures that the system is environmentally sustainable and responsible.

# What are the Technical Components of xHAKT?

xHAKT uses the following components:
- Vite front end for user interaction
- node.js server to process UI requests and surface messages to the user
- CO2.Storage validation service and the carbon neutral CO2.Storage
- Bacalhau for data ingestion
- Hedera for final data storage
